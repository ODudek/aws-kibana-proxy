# AWS Kibana Proxy

## How to run
To configure the proxy, you need the `config.yaml` file, which consists of the following fields:

1. Port on which the proxy server should be launched, for example, `:1234`.
2. ElasticSearch endpoint, for example, `https://xxx.eu-central-1.es.amazonaws.com`.

Once you have created or mounted such a file in the main directory of the project, the application is ready to be launched.
